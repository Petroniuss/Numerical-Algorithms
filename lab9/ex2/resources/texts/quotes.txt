It is not that I am afraid to die.
I just do not want to be there when it happens.

I do not want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to achieve it through not dying.

What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists?
In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpet.

It seemed the world was divided into good and bad people.
The good ones slept better while the bad ones
seemed to enjoy the waking hours much more.
