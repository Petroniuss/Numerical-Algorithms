# Numerical-Algorithms

Assignments completed during 4th semester of studying computer science at AGH.

This class was one of my favourites as we implemented a bunch of interesting things:
- web search engine 
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using only discrete fourier transform and convolution theorem
- used simmualted annealing to solve tsp and sudoku 
- solving electric circuit 

and many more smaller tasks..


Each directory should contain some form of a report together with .ipynb file.
